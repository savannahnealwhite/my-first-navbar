# My First Navbar

### Part 1 - Clone the project
* Begin by _forking_ this project into a personal repository.
   * To do this, click the `Fork` button located at the top right of this page.
* Navigate to your github profile to find the _newly forked repository_.
* Clone the repository from **your account** into the `~/dev` directory.
* Open the newly cloned project in a code editor (Visual Studio Code, for example).

### Part 2 - Creating the navbar
* Research the _navbar_ patterns by visiting the [w3 school tutorial on navbars](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_navbar.asp).
* Modify the `index.html` file by creating a navbar.
* Each `href` property in the navbar should navigate to a newly created `.html` file.
    * Create at least 4 new files that the navbar will navigate to.

### Part 3 - Submit Assignment
* Submit the quiz by _pushing_ the changes you have made to the project.
* Execute the following commands from the _root directory_ of the project to _push_ changes to your repository.
    * `git add .`
    * `git commit -m 'finished assignment'`
    * `git push -u origin master`
    
### Part 4 - Modify previous projects
* Using the information and code that you now know, modify either your [bootstrap-resume](https://github.com/CodeDifferently/my-first-bootstrap-resume) or your [multipage-project](https://github.com/CodeDifferently/my-multipage-project) to include an additional navigation bar.
